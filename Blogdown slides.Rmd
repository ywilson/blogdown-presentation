# Setting up Github

##

Putting your site on github is mandatory for creating and deploying your website.

- On Github.com, intialize a new repositry by pressing the "+" button in the top right corner, press New Repository, Name the Repository, then click **Initialize this repository with a README** << create Repository

- Once created, go to the green **Clone or Download** button. Press the **Copy to Clipboard** button.

- In R Stuido, go to File << New Project << Version Control << Git Repository. Paste your link into the **Repository URL** space, name your directory, then press **Create New Projet**.

# Installing and Running Blogdown and Hugo

##

All code should be ran in the terminal unless noted otherwise

- Install Blogdown
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/blogdown")
```

- Install Hugo
```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::install_hugo()
```


## 

- Create a new site 
```{r,eval=FALSE}
blogdown::new_site() #default theme = "lithium"
```

- Render the site in R Studio **DO NOT KNIT**
```{r,eval=FALSE}
blogdown::serve_site() 
```

**NOTE** This is just the standard default site used for tutorial purposes.

##

**Pushing to Github**

Most work involving github is commiting and pushing your site. 

In order to deploy your site and add updates to your deployed site, you must commit and push each time.

After you build your site, go to the "Git" tab where your "Environment","History", and "Files" tabs are in R Studio.

##
- Press the **Commit** button
A new window should open

- In this new window, there is a text box on the right that has **commit message** on top. 
- In this box, write any new changes that have been done to your code. If it is when you first created it,
comment "initial commit".
- Check the boxes next to all your files, then press the **commit** button at the bottom of the text box.
- Press the green **push** button in the top right corner.

**NOTE** You must both **commit** AND **push** for your site to be updated on github and where ever it is hosted.

- Check github to make sure it is updated with what is currently in R Studio.


# Deployment using Netlify

##

- Set up Netlify account at https://www.netlify.com/
- Sign up with your github
- Press **New Site from Git**

In the following page

- Press **Github**
- Authorize Netlify to have access to your github then follow the steps to sign in to your github
- Select the repo that your site is in.
- On the following page, scroll down and where it says **Publish Directory** put "public".

Your site should now be published

##
**NOTE** Remember to ALWAYS commit **AND** push when updating your site. This is how netlfiy updates your deployed site.

# Customizing your site using Hugo

##

- Visit https://themes.gohugo.io/ in order to choose a theme for your site.
- After choosing a theme, press the **download** button, this should take you to the creater's github.
- Now, you can either add this additional code 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install_theme("your_theme_here", theme_example = TRUE, update_config = TRUE)
```
- Or, go back to your original code and update it to this
```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::new_site(theme = "your_theme_here", theme_example = TRUE)
```

##

To add a theme, you put their github name/ hugo theme repo.
You can just copy and paste it from their site as seen here.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install_theme("MunifTanjim/minimo", theme_example = TRUE, update_config = TRUE)
```
OR
```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::new_site(theme = "MunifTanjim/minimo", theme_example = TRUE)

```
